Directory for language files
============================

This version uses different names for the directories containing the
language files. Users should explicitly set the language the next time
they log in in order to update their user preferences.

You as the system administrator should also manually edit conf/settings.xml
and set the default language to one of the available languages as can
be seen in the directory 'languages'.
