Caution when you update an sqlite database
==========================================

The database changes for this version will require to change the
definition of various columns. This is not easily possible when using
sqlite. Therefore, the affected tables are first renamed, than
new tables with the modified columns are created and the old table
contents will be copied into the new tables. The old tables will
be removed afterwards.

Because sqlite does not support transactions on alter, create and drop
table these changes cannot not be undone in case of an error. Backup
your database before and consider to do the update manually by running

cat install/update-5.1.0/update-sqlite.sql | sqlite data/content.db
