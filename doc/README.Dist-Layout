LetoDMS of installation
=======================

LetoDMS allows various kinds of installations with very individual LetoDMSs
on disc. The proposed LetoDMS till version 5.1.6 was as the following:

LetoDMS51x ---+--- data
              |
              +--- pear
              |
              +--- LetoDMS-5.1.x
              |
              +--- www -> LetoDMS-5.1.x

'data' contains all document files, the sqlite database (if used), the full text
data, the log files, and the cached preview images.

'pear' contains all PEAR packages including the four LetoDMS packages LetoDMS_Core,
LetoDMS_Lucene, LetoDMS_Preview, LetoDMS_SQLiteFTS.

'LetoDMS-5.1.x' are the sources of LetoDMS and 'www' being a link on it.

This LetoDMS has disadvantages when updating the source of LetoDMS, because
the directories 'conf' and 'ext' has to be moved from 'LetoDMS-5.1.x' to
'LetoDMS-5.1.(x+1)'. 'conf' was also visible over the web unless it was
protected by an .htaccess file. The .htaccess file has been shipped, but it
is far better to keep senÑ•itive data out of the document root in the first
place.

The new LetoDMS mostly retains that structure but uses more soft links to place
the local data outside of 'LetoDMS-5.1.x' which makes updating a lot easier
and moves the configuration out of the document root.
As MS Windows does not support soft links, this change will only apply to Linux/Unix
systems. The new LetoDMS is the following:

LetoDMS51x ---+--- data --+-- log
              |           |
              |           +-- ext
              |           |
              |           +-- ...
              |
              +--- pear
              |
              +--- conf
              |
              +--- LetoDMS-5.1.x
              |
              +--- LetoDMS -> LetoDMS-5.1.x
              |
              +--- www --+-- inc -> ../LetoDMS/inc
                         |
                         +-- op -> ../LetoDMS/op
                         |
                         +-- out -> ../LetoDMS/out
                         |
                         +-- views -> ../LetoDMS/views
                         |
                         +-- controllers -> ../LetoDMS/controllers
                         |
                         +-- styles -> ../LetoDMS/styles
                         |
                         +-- languages -> ../LetoDMS/languages
                         |
                         +-- webdav -> ../LetoDMS/webdav
                         |
                         +-- restapi -> ../LetoDMS/restapi
                         |
                         +-- pdfviewer -> ../LetoDMS/pdfviewer
                         |
                         +-- index.php -> ../LetoDMS/index.php
                         |
                         +-- ext -> ../data/ext

In order to convert to this LetoDMS you need to do the following in the LetoDMS51x
directory:

ln -s LetoDMS-5.1.x LetoDMS
mv www/conf .
mv www/ext data
rm www
mdkir www
cd www
ln -s ../LetoDMS/inc
ln -s ../LetoDMS/op
ln -s ../LetoDMS/out
ln -s ../LetoDMS/views
ln -s ../LetoDMS/controllers
ln -s ../LetoDMS/styles
ln -s ../LetoDMS/languages
ln -s ../LetoDMS/webdav
ln -s ../LetoDMS/restapi
ln -s ../LetoDMS/pdfviewer
ln -s ../LetoDMS/index.php
ln -s ../data/ext
