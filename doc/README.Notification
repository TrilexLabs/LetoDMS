Notifications
-----------------------------------------------

Most changes made to documents or folders in LetoDMS can be monitored
by the users. Notifications are send by email if a user or group
has subscribed to it. Setting up email is often troublesome, if you
are not running LetoDMS on a Linux server with a running mail server.
In that case you do not have to fill out any of the email settings
except for the From address ('Send from' on the 'System' tab of the
configuration). Mail is send by PHP's mail() function. If the SMTP
host in the configuration is filled out, LetoDMS will use the PEAR
Mail package for delivering mail to the configured server. If you
also fill out the SMTP user, authentication with the SMTP server
will also be done. Some servers like smtp.gmail.com may still complain
about an invalid authentification. You should then check in your
google account if less secure apps are allowed.

registered a notification for the event:
